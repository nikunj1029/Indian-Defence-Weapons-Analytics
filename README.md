# Indian-Defence-Weapons-Analytics
A Power BI dashboard analyzing India’s defence weapons inventory — covering weapon distribution across forces, cost analysis, origin countries, categories, and future modernization plans

This project provides a unified analytical view of India’s defence weapon systems across the Army, Navy, and Air Force. The dashboard highlights total weapon count, cost distribution, inventory value, induction trends, and weapon categories such as fighter jets, naval ships, missiles, rifles, UAVs, and artillery.

It also analyzes origin countries to compare imported vs indigenous weapons and explores manufacturer contributions like DRDO, HAL, BrahMos Aerospace, and others.
A cost-focused section showcases high-value assets (fighter jets, ships, submarines), helping understand financial allocation across forces.
The dashboard additionally includes a future modernization roadmap, showing upcoming weapons, planned induction years, estimated unit costs, and capabilities — giving a forward-looking view of defence upgrades.
Overall, this project converts complex defence datasets into clear insights for decision-making, budget planning, and capability assessment
